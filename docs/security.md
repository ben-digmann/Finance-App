# Security Considerations

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Finance App to protect user data and ensure secure operations.

SOME OF THE BELOW ARE NOT YET IMPLEMENTED!!! THIS IS NOT A PROD-READY APPLICATION YET!!

## Data Protection

### Data at Rest

1. **Database Encryption**
   - Sensitive personal data is encrypted in the database
   - Plaid access tokens are encrypted using AES-256
   - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds

2. **Field-Level Encryption**
   - PII (Personally Identifiable Information) fields are encrypted
   - Financial account numbers and identifiers are encrypted
   - Application secrets and keys are stored securely, not in code

### Data in Transit

1. **Transport Layer Security**
   - All API communications use HTTPS/TLS 1.2+
   - Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enforced
   - Secure cookie attributes (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite)

2. **API Security**
   - Content-Security-Policy headers
   - Prevention of MIME-type sniffing
   - Protection against clickjacking

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Authentication

1. **Password Security**
   - Strong password requirements enforced
   - Secure password hashing with bcrypt
   - Protection against brute force attacks

2. **JWT Implementation**
   - Short token expiration (24 hours)
   - Secure JWT secret management
   - CSRF protection

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - Two-factor authentication option
   - OAuth 2.0 support for social logins

### Authorization Controls

1. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Each user can only access their own data
   - Proper authorization checks on all API endpoints
   - Resource ownership validation

2. **API Request Validation**
   - Input validation for all API requests
   - Sanitization of user inputs
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Plaid Integration Security

1. **Plaid Token Handling**
   - Public tokens exchanged immediately for access tokens
   - Access tokens stored encrypted in the database
   - No storage of end-user bank credentials

2. **Secure Item Management**
   - Regular validation of access token status
   - Prompt handling of re-authentication requirements
   - Proper item removal when accounts are disconnected

3. **Webhook Security**
   - Verification of Plaid webhook signatures
   - Idempotent processing of webhook events
   - Protection against replay attacks

## LLM Integration Security

1. **Data Minimization**
   - Only necessary transaction data sent to LLM
   - No PII or account numbers included in LLM prompts
   - Strict input validation and sanitization

2. **API Key Management**
   - Secure storage of LLM API keys
   - Rotation schedule for API keys
   - Rate limiting to control costs and prevent abuse

## Application Security

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Regular updates of dependencies
   - Vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
   - Software composition analysis

2. **Secure Coding Practices**
   - Protection against common vulnerabilities:
     - SQL injection
     - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
     - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
   - Regular code reviews with security focus

3. **Error Handling**
   - Secure error messages (no sensitive data in errors)
   - Proper exception handling
   - Comprehensive error logging

## Infrastructure Security

1. **Environment Isolation**
   - Separate development, staging, and production environments
   - Network segmentation to isolate components
   - Least privilege access control

2. **Containerization Security**
   - Regular security updates for container images
   - Container image scanning for vulnerabilities
   - Non-root container execution

3. **Access Controls**
   - Strict IAM/RBAC policies
   - Multi-factor authentication for infrastructure access
   - Regular access reviews and principle of least privilege

## Monitoring & Incident Response

1. **Security Monitoring**
   - Comprehensive logging of security events
   - Intrusion detection system
   - Regular log analysis for suspicious activity

2. **Incident Response Plan**
   - Defined security incident response procedures
   - Regular testing of incident response
   - Clear roles and responsibilities

3. **Vulnerability Management**
   - Regular security assessments
   - Vulnerability disclosure process
   - Timely patching of discovered vulnerabilities

## Compliance Considerations

1. **Financial Data Regulations**
   - Compliance with financial regulations
   - Data retention policies
   - Secure data deletion practices

2. **Privacy Compliance**
   - Clear privacy policy
   - User data access and deletion capabilities
   - Consent management

## Security Testing

1. **Automated Security Testing**
   - SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
   - DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning

2. **Manual Security Testing**
   - Regular penetration testing
   - Security code reviews
   - Threat modeling

## Security Development Lifecycle

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Security requirements definition
   - Threat modeling for new features
   - Risk assessment

2. **Development Phase**
   - Secure coding guidelines
   - Developer security training
   - Peer reviews with security focus

3. **Testing Phase**
   - Security test cases
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Security regression testing

4. **Deployment Phase**
   - Secure configuration management
   - Production security verification
   - Post-deployment security checks

5. **Operations Phase**
   - Ongoing monitoring
   - Incident response
   - Regular security updates

## Security Best Practices for Users

1. **Authentication Recommendations**
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication when available
   - Avoid using shared devices for accessing financial data

2. **Access Security**
   - Regular review of connected accounts
   - Prompt disconnection of unused financial accounts
   - Immediate reporting of suspicious activity

3. **Data Awareness**
   - Understanding of what data is stored
   - Knowledge of data sharing practices
   - Awareness of security features

## Third-Party Security

1. **Vendor Assessment**
   - Security assessment of third-party services
   - Review of third-party security practices
   - Regular reassessment of vendor security

2. **API Security**
   - Secure integration with third-party APIs
   - API key rotation
   - Minimal permission scopes
